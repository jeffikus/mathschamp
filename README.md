# Maths Champ
A maths game based off a real life game I played in my Standard 2 (Grade 4) class. My teacher, Mrs Steer, used to have us compete in times tables 1v1 and answer the question quickest. It really helped me a lot, and along with a casette tape I used as well, I got pretty good at this game :) I was the class maths champ many times, but what was great was that several other classmates also won a lot!

I'd like to keep this code open source, as well as the design concepts. I'll probably build a web app first - most likely a PWA so I can port it over to a native app for mobile. 

Initial stack thoughts
- Backend: WP through REST API or Laravel
- Frontend: Perhaps just vanilla JS, Cordova, or even PHP/React WP theme. I dunno yet :) Something that will support PWA usage.

That's it!
